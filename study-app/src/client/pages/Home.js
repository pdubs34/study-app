        This page is, and will be used to give information on the goal of the project. To start, it would give information on the streak such as the origin. Following that, it would continue on to describe all the goals of this website and how it can be used.
        For example, it would have information like the following passage
        </p>
        <p className='paragraph2'>
        Nebraska football has had a popular fanbase since 1890, with a dominant presence in the NCAA since the start. They had many undefeated seasons throughout the early 1900s, before the NCAA college football championship was established. This winning continued throughout the century, not to quite the same success, but close to. Eventually, the special season of 1962 came, which would be the start of a NCAA record.
On November 3, 1962, Nebraska played a home game against the University of Missouri, a long-time rival. Each team entered the contest 5-0, making the game a pivotal game of the season ("Nebraska vs. Missouri Box Score"). Ultimately, Nebraska lost the game 7-16, leading to an unfortunate loss that would leave them unable to make it to a National Championship, but something more important happened. That game marked the first recorded sellout at Memorial Stadium, starting the long streak that has continued through today.

        This passage was taken from my previous research paper, the next page is where the interactive map would be at. It would also potentially contain links to articles about the streak, like wikipedia.
